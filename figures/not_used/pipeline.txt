Figure 2 is the pipeline of our peptide generation. Embedding step is to encode each amoid acid into a 15 dimension vector.  Prediction step is to predict the binding result and collect the feature as well as combinding weights.
MAM step is to calculate the scores in  each sites. And voting means  average all the trained model results. Generating part is to mutate and  generate new peptide.
