Figure 1. A simple version of the prediction part of our PIMA Network. Two 1-D convolution layers are used to extract the biological features.  Global average pooling layer is to reduces the parameters and makes preparation for the next MAM layer.Matrix multiplication is to calulate the weight of each feature.The input of our layer is peptides while the output is the binding rate.
